## 🚀 First Time Setup

### Step 1: Create Data Folder

Create a `data` folder in the same location as the script:

```
ASTRO-NEXUS-Raider/
├── ASTRO-NEXUS Raider.py
├── config.json
├── requirements.txt
└── data/              ← Create this folder
    ├── tokens.txt     ← Create this file
    └── proxies.txt    ← Optional
```

### Step 2: Add Your Tokens

**What are tokens?** Tokens are like passwords that let ASTRO-NEXUS control your Discord accounts.

**How to get tokens:**

1. **Open Discord in Browser** → Go to [discord.com/app](https://discord.com/app)
2. **Open Developer Tools** → Press `F12` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
3. **Go to Console Tab** → Click "Console" at the top
4. **Paste this code** and press Enter:

```javascript
(webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()
```

5. **Copy the token** → It will appear as a long string
6. **Paste in `data/tokens.txt`** → One token per line

**Example `tokens.txt`:**
```
MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4.AbCdEf.GhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890
OTg3NjU0MzIxMDk4NzY1NDMyMQ.XyZaBc.DeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXy09876541241
```

#### ❌ Issue: "Windows Defender blocks"
```
Warning: Windows flagging as virus

Reason: False positive (automation tools often trigger antivirus)

Solution:
1. Add to Windows Defender exclusions
2. Run anyway (if you trust the source)
3. Download from official GitHub only
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 Efficiency Tips

```
✅ Use Token Checker [04] regularly to remove dead tokens
✅ Start with small numbers (5-10 tokens) to test
✅ Increase delays if getting rate limited
✅ Use proxies for large operations (100+ tokens)
✅ Save important configs before experimenting
✅ Keep backup of valid tokens separately
```

### 🛡️ Safety Tips

```
⚠️ Never use your main Discord account
⚠️ Create alt accounts with temp emails
⚠️ Use VPN or proxies for extra protection
⚠️ Don't spam servers you care about
⚠️ Start slow and observe Discord's response
⚠️ Keep operations reasonable (don't go crazy)
```

### ⚡ Performance Tips

```
🚀 Close unnecessary programs when running
🚀 Use SSD instead of HDD for better speed
🚀 Wired internet > WiFi for stability
🚀 More threads = faster (but more resource intensive)
🚀 Use proxies to bypass IP-level rate limits
🚀 Regular PC = 10-20 tokens, Good PC = 50-100 tokens
```

### 💰 Token Collection Tips

```
💎 Use option [29] Token Scrape weekly
💎 Create accounts yourself with temp-mail.org
💎 Ask friends to donate alt accounts
💎 Trade with other automation users
💎 Buy cheap accounts (NOT recommended, risky)
💎 Keep your collection organized and validated
```
